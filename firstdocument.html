          Stevan Stojanović Mokranjac (January 9, 1856–1914) was a Serbian
          composer and music educator. His work was essential in bringing the
          spirit of Valach Serbian unwritten folk poems into organized art.

      <section>
        <p>
          He was born in Negotin. From the birthplace of his parents he drew the
          second last name Mokranjac (literally: resident of Mokranje).
        </p>
        <p>
          He graduated from the Belgrade high school, and attended the natural
          science and mathematics section of the University of Belgrade. In 1879
          he traveled to Munich where he studied music in the class of Josef
          Rheinberger. After a brief break, he continued to study in Rome in the
          class of Parisotti, in 1884. Returning to Serbia in 1884 he briefly
          became the conductor of the Kornelije Stanković choir of Belgrade.
        </p>
        <p>
          From 1885 to 1887 he studied music in Leipzig, Germany. Upon his
          return to Serbia in 1887 he became the conductor of the Belgrade
          singing society (Belgrade Choir). From 1887 to 1900 he taught music at
          the Belgrade high school, and in 1901 transferred to Bogoslovija
          (Belgrade Theological College) where he taught church singing.
          Together with Stanislav Binički and Cvetko Manojlović, Mokranjac
          founded the first independent music school in 1899 - Serbian Music
          School in Belgrade. He remains the director of this school until his
          death. Today the school bears his name. His work as a melograph bore
          many transcriptions of thus far unwritten folk songs.
        </p>
        <p>
          Stevan Mokranjac died in Skopje, Macedonia (then Kingdom of Serbia),
          aged 58.
        </p>
        <p>
          Every year, the town of Negotin organizes a music festival in his
          honor called Mokranjčevi dani (Days of Mokranjac). The town also has a
          Mokranjac museum.

          His life was highly influenced by church and folk songs, and he used
          these two types of music as inspiration for his work. His most famous
          pieces are the fifteen Rukoveti (Potpourri; literally: "handfuls" or
          "bunches") - a collection of songs and music (orchestral suites) based
          on motives of Serbian folk music from Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia
          Proper, Montenegro, Kosovo and Metohija, Macedonia and Bulgaria. His
          other prominent folk-based works include Primorski napjevi (Coastland
          tunes), and Kozar.
        </p>
        <p>
          A significant number of his works were made for church services. Such
          as the Božanstvena Liturgija Svetog Jovana Zlatoustog (The Divine
          Liturgy of St. Chrysostom), from which the Heruvimska pesma (Cherubic
          hymn) is most famous. Another two famous religious pieces are Tebe
          Boga hvalim (Te Deum) and Veličanije Sv. Savi (Megalynarion to St.
          Sava).
